changelog=1.2 - New Auto-Refresh Mode (suggestion from github.com/TurboGraphxBeige):
        * OFF: The Visible Layers panel updates only when manually refreshed; layers and groups can be toggled individually.
        * ON: The panel syncs in real-time with the main Layers panel, including visibility, order, and structure; the list becomes read-only.
    - Full support for groups:
        * Groups now appear in the Visible Layers panel with the same hierarchy and order as in the main Layers panel.
        * Group visibility can be toggled (manual mode), and layers respect group visibility states.
  1.1 - Added contextual menu on right-click (suggestion from u/ReddmitPy)
  - Added style overview square (which updates automatically)

  1.0.3 - Removed duplicate toolbar button to simplify the interface
